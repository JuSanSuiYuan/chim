{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"temporary value dropped while borrowed","code":{"code":"E0716","explanation":"A temporary value is being dropped while a borrow is still in active use.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0716\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nfn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet p = bar(&foo());\n         // ------ creates a temporary\nlet q = *p;\n```\n\nHere, the expression `&foo()` is borrowing the expression `foo()`. As `foo()` is\na call to a function, and not the name of a variable, this creates a\n**temporary** -- that temporary stores the return value from `foo()` so that it\ncan be borrowed. You could imagine that `let p = bar(&foo());` is equivalent to\nthe following, which uses an explicit temporary variable.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0597\n# fn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\n# fn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet p = {\n  let tmp = foo(); // the temporary\n  bar(&tmp) // error: `tmp` does not live long enough\n}; // <-- tmp is freed as we exit this block\nlet q = p;\n```\n\nWhenever a temporary is created, it is automatically dropped (freed) according\nto fixed rules. Ordinarily, the temporary is dropped at the end of the enclosing\nstatement -- in this case, after the `let p`. This is illustrated in the example\nabove by showing that `tmp` would be freed as we exit the block.\n\nTo fix this problem, you need to create a local variable to store the value in\nrather than relying on a temporary. For example, you might change the original\nprogram to the following:\n\n```\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nfn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet value = foo(); // dropped at the end of the enclosing block\nlet p = bar(&value);\nlet q = *p;\n```\n\nBy introducing the explicit `let value`, we allocate storage that will last\nuntil the end of the enclosing block (when `value` goes out of scope). When we\nborrow `&value`, we are borrowing a local variable that already exists, and\nhence no temporary is created.\n\nTemporaries are not always dropped at the end of the enclosing statement. In\nsimple cases where the `&` expression is immediately stored into a variable, the\ncompiler will automatically extend the lifetime of the temporary until the end\nof the enclosing block. Therefore, an alternative way to fix the original\nprogram is to write `let tmp = &foo()` and not `let tmp = foo()`:\n\n```\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nfn bar(x: &i32) -> &i32 { x }\nlet value = &foo();\nlet p = bar(value);\nlet q = *p;\n```\n\nHere, we are still borrowing `foo()`, but as the borrow is assigned directly\ninto a variable, the temporary will not be dropped until the end of the\nenclosing block. Similar rules apply when temporaries are stored into aggregate\nstructures like a tuple or struct:\n\n```\n// Here, two temporaries are created, but\n// as they are stored directly into `value`,\n// they are not dropped until the end of the\n// enclosing block.\nfn foo() -> i32 { 22 }\nlet value = (&foo(), &foo());\n```\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"crates\\chim-linker\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":5954,"byte_end":5967,"line_start":243,"line_end":243,"column_start":22,"column_end":35,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let linker = Linker::new()","highlight_start":22,"highlight_end":35}],"label":"creates a temporary value which is freed while still in use","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"crates\\chim-linker\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":6183,"byte_end":6184,"line_start":248,"line_end":248,"column_start":30,"column_end":31,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"            .static_linking();","highlight_start":30,"highlight_end":31}],"label":"temporary value is freed at the end of this statement","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.rustup\\toolchains\\nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\lib/rustlib/src/rust\\library\\core\\src\\macros\\mod.rs","byte_start":1375,"byte_end":1381,"line_start":44,"line_end":44,"column_start":16,"column_end":22,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        match (&$left, &$right) {","highlight_start":16,"highlight_end":22}],"label":"borrow later used here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":{"span":{"file_name":"crates\\chim-linker\\src\\lib.rs","byte_start":6194,"byte_end":6249,"line_start":250,"line_end":250,"column_start":9,"column_end":64,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        assert_eq!(linker.config.output, PathBuf::from(\"test\"));","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":64}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},"macro_decl_name":"assert_eq!","def_site_span":{"file_name":"C:\\Users\\Administrator\\.rustup\\toolchains\\nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\\lib/rustlib/src/rust\\library\\core\\src\\macros\\mod.rs","byte_start":1294,"byte_end":1316,"line_start":42,"line_end":42,"column_start":1,"column_end":23,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"macro_rules!
